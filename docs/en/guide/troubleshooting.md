# Troubleshooting

You will learn how to debug OpenFlare Server, database, login, Agent, OpenResty, release, and frontend build issues by symptom.

Start by locating the failing layer: browser, Server, database, Agent, OpenResty, origin, or DNS. OpenFlare applies configuration only after a version is activated and the Agent discovers it through heartbeat.

## Quick Triage

| Symptom | Check First |
| --- | --- |
| Management UI does not open | Server process/container logs and port binding |
| Login fails | Default account, `SESSION_SECRET`, browser request, Server logs |
| Data cannot be saved | Database connection, SQLite permissions, PostgreSQL health |
| Agent is offline | Agent logs, token, Server URL, network reachability |
| Node does not update after release | Active version, node heartbeat, apply logs |
| OpenResty apply fails | Apply logs, Agent logs, certificates, upstream URL, port conflicts |
| No access analytics | OpenResty status, observability port, Agent replay logs |

## Server Does Not Start

1. Check logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -n 200 openflare
```

For source runs, check terminal output.

2. Check port usage:

```bash
lsof -i :3000
```

3. If PostgreSQL is used, check database health:

```bash
docker compose ps postgres
docker compose logs -n 100 postgres
```

4. If SQLite is used, check that the database directory is writable:

```bash
ls -ld "$(dirname /path/to/openflare.db)"
```

Common causes:

| Log or Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Database connection failed | Check username, password, host, port, database, and `sslmode` in `DSN` |
| SQLite cannot create file | Check that the `SQLITE_PATH` directory exists and is writable |
| Port is already in use | Change `PORT` or `--port`, or stop the process using the port |

## UI Does Not Open or Is Blank

1. Confirm that the Server responds:

```bash
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

2. For source runs, confirm frontend static assets were built:

```bash
cd openflare_server/web
pnpm build
```

3. Check whether the browser URL matches your reverse proxy setup.

4. If using the frontend dev server, confirm backend proxy configuration:

```bash
cd openflare_server/web
NEXT_DEV_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 pnpm dev
```

## Default Account Cannot Sign In

The default account is `root` / `123456`. If the password was changed after first login, use the updated password.

Steps:

1. Confirm the Server is connected to the expected database, not another `SQLITE_PATH` or `DSN`.
2. Check Server logs to see whether it uses `sqlite` or `postgres`.
3. If deployed behind replicas or a reverse proxy, ensure `SESSION_SECRET` is fixed and consistent across instances.
4. Clear browser cookies and try again.

[Needs confirmation: whether the project provides a safe root password reset command or procedure]

## Agent Cannot Register or Stays Offline

On the Agent node:

```bash
curl -I http://your-server:3000
```

Check Agent logs:

```bash
journalctl -u openflare-agent -n 200 --no-pager
```

Check config:

```bash
sed -n '1,160p' /opt/openflare-agent/agent.json
```

Confirm:

| Config | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `server_url` | Must be reachable from the Agent node |
| `agent_token` / `discovery_token` | At least one is required |
| `heartbeat_interval` | Supports millisecond integers or Go duration strings |
| `request_timeout` | Increase it for slow networks |

If the log says the token is invalid, prepare a new token in the UI, update `agent.json`, and restart:

```bash
systemctl restart openflare-agent
```

## Node Does Not Apply a New Version

Check in order:

1. The target version is active on the versions page.
2. The node is online and heartbeat time is updating.
3. Apply logs contain a success, warning, or failure for the target version.
4. The site configuration is enabled.
5. Agent logs show pull, validation, reload, or rollback messages.

Follow Agent logs:

```bash
journalctl -u openflare-agent -f
```

After a target `version + checksum` fails and rolls back, the Agent blocks repeated attempts for that same target locally. Fix the configuration and publish a new checksum, or activate an old version to roll back.

## OpenResty Apply Fails

Common causes:

| Cause | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Domain or server block conflict | Ensure the same domain is not used by multiple sites |
| Invalid upstream URL | Every upstream must be `http://` or `https://` |
| Invalid multi-upstream format | Multiple upstreams must be plain `scheme://host[:port]` |
| Missing certificate or wrong path | Check domain certificate binding and Agent certificate directory permissions |
| Port conflict | Check local or Docker `80` and `443` usage |

Docker OpenResty mode:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=openflare-openresty
docker logs --tail 100 openflare-openresty
```

Local OpenResty mode:

```bash
/usr/local/openresty/nginx/sbin/nginx -t
```

Use the actual path from `openresty_path` in `agent.json`.

## HTTPS Does Not Work

1. Confirm the certificate exists.
2. Confirm the domain is bound to that certificate in the site configuration.
3. Confirm a new version was published and activated.
4. Check apply logs for success.
5. Inspect with `curl`:

```bash
curl -Iv https://your-domain
```

Domains without a bound certificate are not automatically added to HTTPS configuration.

## No Access Analytics

1. Confirm the node applied a configuration that includes observability Lua assets.
2. Confirm Docker OpenResty or local OpenResty is running.
3. Check Agent logs for collection or replay failures.
4. Check whether `openresty_observability_port` is occupied. The default is `18081`.
5. Confirm Server cleanup policy did not remove data for that time window.

## Frontend Build Fails

```bash
cd openflare_server/web
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Common causes:

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| pnpm version mismatch | Run `corepack enable` and reinstall |
| Type errors | Run `pnpm typecheck` to locate files |
| API type mismatch | Check `lib/api/` and `types/` response structures |
| E2E fails | Ensure both the Server and frontend dev server are running |

## Docs Build Fails

```bash
cd docs
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

If the failure is a link error, check that new pages are added to `docs/en/config.ts` and that relative links point to existing Markdown files.
